Matplotlib_Challenge observation
Background

You've just joined Pymaceuticals Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer pharmaceuticals. Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

As a senior data analyst at the company, you've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated with a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens.

The executive team has tasked you with generating all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the study. They have also asked for a top-level summary of the study results.

The first observation is a decrease in tumor volume within 35 days in mice receiving Capomulin Treatment over the time point as displayed in the line graph.

Secondly,average tumor volume is higher in mice that weigh more per their size ranging from 17, 21 to 24(g).

Lastly, as much as the Capomulin Treatment is effective there was abit of increase between 25-30days of treatment and thereafter 5 more days, the growth of tumor increased in the mice during this treatment.
